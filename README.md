# sudocore.dev

Sudocore's code base has been directly pulled from Bootstrap. All credit goes to Bootstrap and the Bootstrap Authors for developing such a wonderful framework. 

Sudocore is intended to add more stylistic option straight from the box. Sudocore does this by adding more colors, buttons, and typography.
